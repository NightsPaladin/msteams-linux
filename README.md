# msteams-linux
A linux client for MS Teams (unofficial)

This work is based on the excellent work of Omid Hezaveh <omid.hezaveh@futurice.com> for flowdock-linux (https://github.com/omidfi/flowdock-linux) 

## Create/compile the app:
To create the linux client for MS Teams you need node.js and npm installed, then run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nightspaladin/msteams-linux.git
cd msteams-linux
npm install
node index.js
```

Your MS Teams client will be compiled and placed into a sub-folder named something like MS-Teams-linux... under the msteams-linux repository folder.

## Download the binary (Quick way)
Just download the binary, unpack it and double click to open it!
